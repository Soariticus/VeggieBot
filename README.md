Me being fairly new to development, was very interested in undertaking a simple yet expansive project. A friend of mine ran a discord server for his youtube channel, and for fun, I made a discord bot for him.

This was one of my first undertakings within development, and it's plain to see in the code. It did teach me a lot, though, and was very fun to do. The bot ended up seeing a lot of use, until the eventual death of the discord.py library, upon which, VeggieBotJS was born.
